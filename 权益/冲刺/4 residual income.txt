residual income 
1. ∏≈ƒÓ
	1.1 EVA: economic value added
			= EBIT*(1-t) - WACC * (equity capital + debt capital)
			= NOPAT - WACC * total capital
				total capital = equity capital + debt capital
				NOPAT: Net Operating Profit After Tax
			
	1.2 MVA(market value added)
		MVA = firm market value - total capital
		total capital = bv of long term debt + bv of equity
					  = net WC + net FA
					  = current asset - current liablity + net FA
	1.3 RI: residual income
		RI = NI - equity capital * Re
		   = B0 * (ROE - Re)
		
		
2. π¿÷µ
	2.1 single stage
		P0 = B0 + ¶≤_t=1...inf (RI_t/(1+Re)^t)
		P0 = B0 + B0 * (ROE - Re)/(r-g)
